## Introduction

This script shows an implementation of Deep Q-Learning on the
`BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4` environment.

This example requires the following dependencies: `baselines`, `atari-py`, `rows`.
They can be installed via:

```
git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines.git
cd baselines
pip install -e .
git clone https://github.com/openai/atari-py
wget http://www.atarimania.com/roms/Roms.rar
unrar x Roms.rar .
python -m atari_py.import_roms .
```

### Deep Q-Learning

As an agent takes actions and moves through an environment, it learns to map
the observed state of the environment to an action. An agent will choose an action
in a given state based on a "Q-value", which is a weighted reward based on the
expected highest long-term reward. A Q-Learning Agent learns to perform its
task such that the recommended action maximizes the potential future rewards.
This method is considered an "Off-Policy" method,
meaning its Q values are updated assuming that the best action was chosen, even
if the best action was not chosen.

### Atari Breakout

In this environment, a board moves along the bottom of the screen returning a ball that
will destroy blocks at the top of the screen.
The aim of the game is to remove all blocks and breakout of the
level. The agent must learn to control the board by moving left and right, returning the
ball and removing all the blocks without the ball passing the board.

### Note

The Deepmind paper trained for "a total of 50 million frames (that is, around 38 days of
game experience in total)". However this script will give good results at around 10
million frames which are processed in less than 24 hours on a modern machine.

## Implement the Deep Q-Network

This network learns an approximation of the Q-table, which is a mapping between
the states and actions that an agent will take. For every state we'll have four
actions, that can be taken. The environment provides the state, and the action
is chosen by selecting the larger of the four Q-values predicted in the output layer.
